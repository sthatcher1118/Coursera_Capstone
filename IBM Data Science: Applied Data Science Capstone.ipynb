Use the pandas [`read_html`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_html.html) function to read all the tables from the [List of postal codes of Canada: M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M). The first table (i.e. data frame) in the list will be the first (index = 0) element in the list.\n\n1. After extracting the first table, get all the rows that have an *assigned* Borough (i.e. a Borough not equal to `Not assigned`).\n\n1. According to the lab, there could be a postal code listed multiple times and that the neighborhood values should be combined in a comma separated list. *However*, it appears that the table has been updated and the neighborhoods are listed with `/` as a separator. Let's check...\n\n1. Lastly, I'll just stick with the `/` separator since it seems to be a unique character in the list. I'm assuming that the `Garden District, Ryerson` entry is actually a single place and not two places. Especially since the Garden District is where Ryerson University is located. "
